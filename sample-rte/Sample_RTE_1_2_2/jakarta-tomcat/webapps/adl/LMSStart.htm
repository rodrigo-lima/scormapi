       Welcome to the

       This Sample Run-time Environment implementation provides a working 
       example of the Run-time Environment described in the ADL Sharable 
       Content Object Reference Model (SCORM&reg;) Version 1.2. This is not a 
       complete functioning Learning Management System (LMS), but rather an 
       example of the Run-time Environment as it may be implemented within
       an LMS and within Sharable Content Objects.

       <br />
       <br />
       <font face="tahoma" size="2">This sample consists of:
       <ul>
           <li> An API Adapter implemented as a Java Applet</li>
           <li> A full implementation of the SCORM&reg; Run-time Environment Data Model</li>
           <li> Support for SCORM Version 1.2 conformant Content Packages</li>
           <li> A Simple Sequencing Engine</li>
       </ul>
          
       <p>
          Please note that this sample replaces and supersedes the ADL 
          Sample LMS Versions 1.0 and 2.0 and the Sample RTE Versions 1.1 and 
          1.2.1.
