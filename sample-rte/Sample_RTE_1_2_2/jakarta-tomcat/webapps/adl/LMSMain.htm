** File Description:    This is the main page that contains a frameset which 
**						      in turn contains three frames.  The top frame contains
**                      login, logout, Quit, Previous, and Next buttons. The
**                      lower left frame contains a menu constructed from the
**                      items in the currently selected course.  The content
**                      frame (right-side) initially contains the start page.
**                      When the user logs in and selects a course, lesson,
**                      etc., the right-side frame displays this content.  
**                      This page exposes the DOM API Object so that a
**						      launched SCO is able to find it.  This page will
**                      be the parent, or the parent of the opener window, of 
** 					      launched SCOs.
